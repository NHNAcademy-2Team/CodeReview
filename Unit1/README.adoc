.*What is a computer*
* *Hardware*
** Central Processing Unit(CPU)
*** CPU + 
= Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU) + Control Unit(CU) +
+ a set of Registers (for temporary storage of data, instructions, addresses and intermediate results of calculation)
** Memory Unit
** Input/Output(I/O) Unit
*** input unit converts the data that  it accepts from the user
*** output unit provide the output in a form that is understandable by user

* *How does it work*
** Executes very simple instructions
** Executes them incredibly fast
** Must be programmed: it is the software, i.e., the programs, that characterize what a computer actually does
